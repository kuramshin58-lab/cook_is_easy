# Fridgely

> AI-powered recipe finder that suggests delicious recipes based on ingredients you have. Free web app with smart matching and ingredient substitutions. Stop wasting food, start cooking amazing meals.

Fridgely solves a common problem: you open your fridge, see random ingredients, and don't know what to cook. Our app takes your available ingredients and finds matching recipes from a curated database of 189+ recipes.

## Key Features

- **Smart Ingredient Matching**: Enter ingredients you have, get recipes ranked by match percentage
- **Weighted Scoring**: Key ingredients (proteins, main starches) matter more than seasonings
- **Ingredient Substitutions**: 100+ substitution mappings - missing cream? Use coconut milk
- **Difficulty Filters**: Easy, medium, or hard recipes based on your skill level
- **Time Filters**: 20, 40, or 60 minute cooking time options
- **AI Recipe Generation**: When database doesn't have matches, AI creates custom recipes

## How It Works

1. User enters ingredients they have (e.g., chicken, pasta, garlic)
2. System searches 189+ recipe database
3. Each recipe scored by weighted ingredient matching:
   - Key ingredients (chicken, beef, pasta): 10x weight
   - Important ingredients (vegetables, cheese): 5x weight
   - Flavor ingredients (spices, herbs): 2x weight
   - Base ingredients (salt, oil, water): 0 weight
4. Results show match percentage (e.g., "95% match")
5. Each recipe includes substitution suggestions for missing ingredients
