## Technical Architecture

### Stack

### Search Algorithm

The weighted scoring system ensures relevant results:

```
Score = Σ (ingredient_weight × match_type_multiplier)

Ingredient Weights:
- key (proteins, main starches): 10

- flavor (spices, herbs): 2
- base (salt, oil, water): 0

Match Types:

```
