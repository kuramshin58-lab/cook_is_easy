Easy tempeh stir-fry with crunchy veggies,"Quick to make, packed with flavor and, thanks to tempeh, full of good plant protein: This tempeh stir-fry is already your new go-to for healthy, colorful, and no-fuss meals. Tempeh is made from soybeans just like tofu, but its fermentation gives it a unique edge, making it firmer in texture, nuttier in taste and even more protein rich. In this recipe, it's fried until crispy, then coated in a glossy sweet-salty sauce that pairs perfectly with those crunchy veggies. The best thing is that you can switch up those veggies depending on the season, your pantry, or simply what you like. Take some broccoli, snow peas, or pak choi; it's all up to you here.

Warm bulgur salad with roasted zucchini and radicchio,"Let bulgur salad prove itself to be a really cozy dish, and you'll be prepared for any cold day that's coming your way. You'll not only have a cozy autumn Mediterranean meal, but also get a kick of nutritious flavors thanks to the harmony between the zucchini, radicchio, and grapes. Radicchio brings a tart character into this bulgur salad, especially when it's fried in brown butter! It loses most of the bitterness, but rather develops an intense, aromatic flavor. The grapes will be the exciting contrast you need to try this season with the sweet, juicy kick they bring. My two tips are; to lose all the bitterness you can put sliced radicchio in an ice bath for approx. 20 min. before frying, and adding crumbled feta or roasted almond slices to get an even richer taste if you like. This salad will taste the best fresh, but lukewarm or room temperature also works.",Medium 👍,25 min,25 min,4 portions,"200g bulgur, 400ml water, 2 zucchini, 240g canned chickpeas, 2 cloves garlic, 200g red grapes, 3 tbsp olive oil, 1 radicchio, 40g butter, 40g pine nuts, 10g parsley, 1 lemon, 1 tbsp honey, salt, pepper","1.
